        In a time when too many people has lost control over their own lives.
        Where many others work in jobs they dislike ,and many don't even have a
        job. The existence of advanced technologies that are easyily
        accessible to everyone,and the correct use of it ,should contribute to
        create alternatives much more attractive than the existent ones. An
        universe of possibilities is in front of us ,but seems like society is
        failing in catch up with the time we are in. Let's combine
        software,hardware and all kind of services ,we can provide the vehicle
        to express new ideas  and create new ways of living around the
        communities we help. <br></br> Whatever we do is try to free people of
        artificial scarce needs. Push them start to produce and capitalize on
        healthy organic foods, instead of the questionable other options that
        the big corporations give.Make them find a way to enrich their life
        creating new  relations, with like minded people interested in positive
        things, making look absurd that people nowadays , could feel alone or
        isolated,even if there are 7 billion people and almost  everyone has a
        cellphone.Give them more free time,with the assistance of the devices
        and the automation in the work area,your time.Gain control over your
        food,energy,economy and life in general .
