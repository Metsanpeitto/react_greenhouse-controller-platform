        We are already experiencing the artificial scarcity of some resources.
        The speculation with the prices of basic needs,as energy, water,
        housing  or food. The displacement of the population from rural areas to
        the cities ,in search of a chance to improve their economic
        situation,adds more people into a life separated from the source of
        their daily diet. The lack of room in the food industry,for many little
        producers,that can not compete with the big corporations  ,the large
        mono culture fields or the sophisticated, and prohibitive in
        price,machinery  needed to work them, make the option of move back to
        the country really complicated.  There is indeed, a will ,of many
        people, who really look to these areas as way to improve ,not only their
        quality of life, but also their financial situation. Thanks to a change
        in the way of understanding the process and techniques of producing
        vegetables, a more sustainable fertilization based on the coexistence of
        fishes and plants in the same medium, will increase the
        production,reducing the nitrogenation of the waste water and therefore
        the soil where that water would be applied. With the help of electronic
        devices and software applications, all kind of tools can be develop to
        assist in the process and control the conditions of both,plants and
        fishes.

        Nurumia doesn't focus  only in rural areas,but in those areas with the
        need of a good substrate, a warmer or  colder atmosphere, or the
        constraint of horizontal space. For that reason ,Nurumia could be
        installed in urban spaces too ,taking advantage of the modularity and
        versatilty  when plating in pipes, that could for example ,hang on the
        walls. The most relevant part ,is the fact of communicate with persons
        in the same situation. People demanding a different way of do things and
        calling for action with their implication in a community , where they
        have a voice and real capability of transform how we see food
        industry.The data obtained from every single device is analyzed with the
        intention of feedback modifications in the parameters of the spaces to
        be controlled. This feedback's open the gates to expand our
        understanding of the process and the systems involved in it.  We
        contribute with people jelping each other,owning their own food source
        and creating their own economy and relations around it.
