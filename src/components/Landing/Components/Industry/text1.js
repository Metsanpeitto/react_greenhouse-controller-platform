      <strong>What it is?</strong>
      <p>
        Aquaponics is the integration of aquaculture and hydroponics. There is
        expanding interest in aquaponics as a form of aquaculture that can be
        used to produce food closer to urban centers. Commercial aquaponics uses
        methods and equipment from both the hydroponics and aquaculture
        industries. There have been few studies of commercial-scale aquaponics
        production, and the purpose of this research was to document the
        production methods, crop and fish yields, and profitability of
        commercial aquaponics in the United States (US) and internationally.
