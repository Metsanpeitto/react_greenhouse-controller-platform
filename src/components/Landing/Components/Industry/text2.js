        Aquaponics Market is segmented by its technique such as Raft, Nutrient
        Film Technique, Media based aquaponics, Vertical aquaponics, and Others.
        Currently, there are three primary aquaponic methods emerging in the
        industry namely raft, NFT, and media-filled beds. In the raft system,
        plants float on to the surface of the water allowing the roots to hang
        down into the water. This process is also known as float, deep channel,
        and deep flow technique
        <br></br>
        Aquaponics process consumes less water while providing food security.
        Hence this technique is well suited at places where there is poor
        availability of natural resources such as in deserts, arid areas; sandy
        islands and urban gardens.
