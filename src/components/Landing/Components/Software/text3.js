        <strong>What does open source means?</strong>

        "Open hardware," or "open source hardware," refers to the design
        specifications of a physical object which are licensed in such a way
        that said object can be studied, modified, created, and distributed by
        anyone. "Open hardware" is a set of design principles and legal
        practices, not a specific type of object. The term can therefore refer
        to any number of objects—like automobiles, chairs, computers, robots, or
        even houses. Like open source software, the "source code" for open
        hardware—schematics, blueprints, logic designs, Computer Aided Design
        (CAD) drawings or files, etc.—is available for modification or
        enhancement by anyone under permissive licenses. Users with access to
        the tools that can read and manipulate these source files can update and
        improve the code that underlies the physical device. They can add
        features or fix bugs in the software. They can even modify the physical
        design of the object itself and, if they wish, proceed to share such
        modifications. Open hardware's source code should be readily accessible,
        and its components are preferably easy for anyone to obtain.
        Essentially, open hardware eliminates common roadblocks to the design
        and manufacture of physical goods; it provides as many people as
        possible the ability to construct, remix, and share their knowledge
