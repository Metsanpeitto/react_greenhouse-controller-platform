        Apart from controlling and monitoring the environment.It also logs all
        the data , making it easier ,to later on,study it ,and implement
        solutions. Data from sensors and firmware code are open to the
        members.They could open chat groups about the est ways to implement
        optimizations ,or new ideas derived from unexpected realizations made by
        analyzing the data. The community can maintain the code,or open new
        branches .Specialized crops can have their own dedicated edition of the
        software.<br></br>
        One of the goals of this project,is created a feedback of ideas and
        data, from where the production and quality increases.At the same time
        the code must be kept updated and open to modifications.
