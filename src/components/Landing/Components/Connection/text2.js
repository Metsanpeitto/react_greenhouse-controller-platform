        When you purchase direct from the farm, odds are the produce was picked
        within days or even just hours of your purchase — it doesn’t get much
        fresher! And the fresher the produce, the better the flavor! Farmers are
        part of the local community, so they’re conscientious of the quality of
        the products they’re selling. And an on-farm purchase most likely means
        there was no middleman, which further decreases the time the produce
        went from the farmer’s fields into your hands, and ultimately onto your
        table.

        <strong>Know where your food comes from </strong>

      <p>
        There’s added value in knowing exactly where your food comes from. When
        you purchase directly from a farmer, you have a direct line to
        understand how the food was produced. You can probably even drive by the
        field where that head of lettuce you just purchased was picked, or the
        orchard the peach you’re eating came from, or the dairy parlor where the
        cows are milked. Even better, find a U-pick operation and pick your
        produce yourself!
