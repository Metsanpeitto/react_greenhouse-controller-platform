        The environment to control is divided in air,water and light. Air
        humidity and temperature ,inside and outside the installation are
        monitored by their own sensors. The water temperature,ph and level also
        have sensors dedicated. Light pressence in the wrong time can cause
        losts and make a crop fail. It is solved with another sensor. And
        lastly,the pressence detector sends an alarm ,if detects movement inside
        the unit ,at a time when no one should be there.
