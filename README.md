  And a webapp designed to control and manage it . From the mechanical components as lamp or heaters,to the task 
 management.<br></br>

 The webapp contains until now 5 different sections.<br></br>
   -Charts and dashboard with the last values recorded and posted from the device.<br></br>
   -A control panel where to setup the different parameters of the greenhouse.<br></br>
   -A Chat where members of the greenhouse and from another greenhouses can communicate.<br></br>
   -A Task manager connected to a database where to manage and share tasks and events.<br></br>
   -An alarm monitor log with the history of the alarm events in the past .<br></br>
   
The webApp is accesible from a webPage that serves as landing page for the platform in general .
